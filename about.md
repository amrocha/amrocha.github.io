Hi there!

My name is Andr√© Rocha, and I'm a software engineer and general technology nerd.

I started this blog both as a means of practicing my writing and to keep track of whatever personal projects and ideas I'm working on at any given time. I will probably post a lot about programming, but every once in a while I might have something different to share.

If you want to get in touch then the best way is to email me at andrematheus94[at]gmail.com. You can find my resume [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0oq7fyby06wf2d7/AndreCV2.0.pdf?dl=0).
